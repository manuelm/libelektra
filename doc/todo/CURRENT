Add items here which should be implemented within the next release.
Release often, so keep this list very short.
During implementation phase no new items may be added here (only
those which are necessary to fulfil the initial tasks)
Items are e.g. BUGS, OPTIMIZE, PROBLEMS, TESTING, PLUGINS, TODO,..


== 0.8.5 ==

write release notes

gen:
	Contextual
	cleanup: utilities for cheetha+python

== 0.8.6 ==

allow key names starting with /?

define sprintf+strtoXX
string not needed: will be assumed if no type .given
additional test cases with all types (min, max)

Starting points:
	add small Tutorial for gen
	add docu to examples


announcements: docu
	gen
	kdb <tool>
	tools

fix types:
	type checker should check like defined in schema
	let json use same types (double, boolean, nothing for string)

template naming conventions
refactor template code a bit (util class)

=== tools ===

make exec subfolder in kdb
kdb- prefix unnecessary
mv scripts to tools

=== test ===

check on 32bit system

=== install ===

install test scripts to tool exec path
install test data + path
man page path
additional pathes must be in kdb repo (man pages, test data, templates)
install man pages correctly under elektra3
